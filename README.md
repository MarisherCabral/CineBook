# CineBook: MEVN Stack Cinema Booking and Management System
CineBook is a full-stack, comprehensive web application designed to streamline cinema operations and provide a seamless movie ticket booking experience for users. It is built using the MEVN stack (MongoDB, Express, Vue.js, Node.js) with modern styling provided by Tailwind CSS.

The platform features a secure and efficient dual-interface model: a powerful Admin Dashboard for content management and an intuitive User Interface for browsing and booking.

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up the full MEVN environment:

1. Backend Setup (Node.js/Express)
Navigate to the server directory (e.g., /server or root if using the single-folder structure):
# Install server-side dependencies (Express, Mongoose, nodemon, etc.)
npm install
# Start the backend server with nodemon for live reload
# This is the command used to run the Express API:
npx nodemon server.js

2. Frontend Setup (Vue.js)
Navigate to the client directory (e.g., /client):
# Install client-side dependencies (Vue, Vue-router, Tailwind dependencies)
npm install
# Start the Vue development server (typically on port 8080 or 5173)
# This command runs the Vite/Vue CLI development server:
npm run dev
